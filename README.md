Multiple Stock Year Data

Created a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

1. The ticker symbol.
2. Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
3. The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
4. The total stock volume of the stock.

There is also conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

The solution also returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 

The script should also loop through all the sheets in the worksheet on running once.

The "Multi_Stock_Year_Data_Results_Images" folder has the screenshots of results of each sheet/year. 
There are two screenshots per sheet/year - one for the starting of the summary table and one for the ending of the summary table.
